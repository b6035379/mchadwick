Repository for Advanced System Architectures second assignment.
 This assignment was completed on a Linux Virtual Machine. 

If you wish to view and navigate around the completed application, you will need to do so on a Linux System/Virtual Machine. I am able to provide you with a .7zip archive of the virtual machine clone to open in VMWare, along with instructions on how to get the local environment running to access the web application if desired.
